This is a draft version of the interactive textbook *Text Mining with Python* by [Neal Caren](mailto:neal.caren@gmail.com), Associate Professor of Sociology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

All of the instructional pages have two buttons at the top of the page to provide you with the opportunity  to run and modify all the code yourself online. The "Interactive" allows you to run and modify  each code cell on the page. The "Launch Notebook" button redirects you to a live version of a Jupyter Notebook. Both of these are powered by [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org).
