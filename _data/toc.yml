#
# title: Title of chapter or section
# url: URL of section. Use absolute URLs to link between pages
# class: (optional) a CSS class to add to this link
# sections: Contains chapter's sections
# not_numbered: true if the section shouldn't have a number in the sidebar
#   (e.g. Introduction or appendices)
# expand_sections: true if you'd like the sections of this chapter to always
#   be expanded in the sidebar.
# divider: true if this entry should just be rendered as a horizontal divider
#   in the sidebar. All other values are ignored.
